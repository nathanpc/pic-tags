# PIC Tags Manager

A simple utility to manage the [ctags](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ctags) for PIC headers. This is a must if you want to program PIC microcontrollers without using Microchip's [MPLAB X](https://www.microchip.com/mplab/mplab-x-ide) monstrosity.

We recommend using [universal-ctags](https://ctags.io/) since it's more up-to-date than [exuberant-ctags](http://ctags.sourceforge.net/).
